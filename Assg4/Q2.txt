2. int arr[5]={2,8,18,34,5};
char ch[6]=”abcde”;
cout<<arr<<endl;
cout<<ch;
What output will you get in each line(address is printed or something else)? Why so?

the first line would have the address of arr
the second line would print abcde. 

cout by default prints the address of the int array and the string in case of char array
